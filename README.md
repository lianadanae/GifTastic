# GifTastic
Built with:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, GIPHY API


The GifTastic application searches the GIPHY API to find gifs by pressing search buttons.  There is a selection of buttons that are pre-defined, but users can create other buttons through the form on the page.  Gifs are displayed with their rating and can be played by pressing them.
